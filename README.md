# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository demonstrates data wrangling, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to prepare the data, uncover insights, and build predictive models for survival prediction.

## Overview

This project includes:
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming raw features into a usable format for machine learning.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Deriving insights through descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predicting survival outcomes using various classification techniques.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Features

- Comprehensive data preprocessing, including:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Engineering new features from existing data.
- EDA to uncover relationships and trends in the data.
- Implementation of predictive models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
- Performance evaluation using robust metrics.
