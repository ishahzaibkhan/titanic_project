# Titanic Seaborn

A comprehensive project for exploring and visualizing the Titanic dataset using Python's powerful visualization library, Seaborn, along with additional tools for data preprocessing and machine learning.

## Overview

This repository focuses on:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with Seaborn visualizations to uncover patterns and insights from the Titanic dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing** techniques, including handling missing values, feature encoding, and data transformation.
- **Machine Learning Models** to predict survival outcomes with metrics to evaluate performance.

Whether you're a data science enthusiast or a beginner, this project provides an excellent foundation for exploring data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Features

- Visualize trends and relationships in the Titanic dataset using Seaborn.
- Preprocess raw data for machine learning, including handling missing data and categorical encoding.
- Build predictive models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
